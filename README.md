3. **JSP** – for displaying output

This project fulfills the requirements of Assignment 1 for CSC584.

  - Student Name  
  - Student ID  
  - Program  
  - Email  
  - Hobbies  
  - Self-introduction  
- Mandatory field indicator (*)  
- Placeholder examples for every input  
- Form validation using JavaScript  
- Uses **POST** method

Servlet (PersonalProfileServlet.java)
- Receives form data via POST  
- Extracts form values using `request.getParameter()`  
- Saves values into attributes via `request.setAttribute()`  
- Forwards data to JSP using a RequestDispatcher:

```java
RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher("profile.jsp");
rd.forward(request, response);
```
